<h2>MEV Bot Exploit</h2>
<div>
<p>
On 20220913 A MEV Bot was exploited by an attacker and all the assets on the contract were transferred away, with a total loss of about $140K.
</p>
<p>
The attacker sends a private transaction through the BNB48 validator node, similar to Flashbot not putting the transaction into the public mempool to avoid being Front-run.
</p>
<p>
The way the attack has exploited this MEV Bot was that he decompiled the contract code probably using Dedaub or something else. And then found out that by calling the contracts pancakeCall function which takes as 4th parameter bytes and this function then calls another function which then takes this parameter of bytes and calls transfer funds on to it. Crazy huh.
</p>
<p>
The logic of writing the POC is to call the pancakeCall of the MEV bot contract and then bring in the corresponding parameters. The key is _data to specify the receiving wallet address, and then the contract must have token0, token1 Function to satisfy the contract logic.
