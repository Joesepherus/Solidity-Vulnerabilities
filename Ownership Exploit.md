<h2>What is Ownership Exploit</h2>
<div>
<p>If anyone can call a function of a contract that should only be able to be called by the owner of the contract, that is the Ownership Exploit.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy, but you as a developer should always be thinking what every function you add to your contract should be allowed to be called by, an owner a special privilege user or anyone.</p>
<p>So best is to always start your contract functions with the lowest visiblity "private". So that the function can only be called from within the contract. And if you later on need to change the visibility to more open. But then think about who can call, give your function a modifier "isOwner" if needed to.</p>
