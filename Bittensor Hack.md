<h2>
Bittensor Hack
</h2>
<div>
<p>
Bittensor was hacked for over $8M when a malicious package masquerading as a legitimate Bittensor package, snuck its way into PyPi version 6.12.2.
</p>
<p>
This trojan horse contained code designed to steal unencrypted coldkey details.
</p>
<p>
When unsuspecting users downloaded this package and decrypted their coldkeys, the decrypted bytecode was sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
</p>
<p>
In response to the attack, the Bittensor team quickly put the chain into "safe mode‚Äù, halting all transactions while continuing to produce blocks.
</p>
<p>
This swift action may have prevented further losses, but it also highlighted the centralized control the team maintains over the supposedly decentralized network.
</p>
<p>
The Bittensor hack exposes a critical vulnerability in the crypto ecosystem, the reliance on third-party package managers.
</p>
<p>
While blockchain protocols themselves may be secure, the tools developers use to interact with them can become unexpected points of failure.
