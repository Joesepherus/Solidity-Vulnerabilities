<h2>
Lifi Hack
</h2>
<div>
<p>
The vulnerable contract failed to properly check the call target and call data, allowing an exploiter to perform a "call injection" attack.
</p>
<p>
This enabled the attacker to execute arbitrary functions using the permissions granted to the LiFi contract.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, users who approved the contract for infinite approvals lost their tokens.
</p>
<p>
Funds stolen include USDT, USDC, and DAI totalling approximately $9.73M, which were subsequently swapped for 2,857 ETH.
