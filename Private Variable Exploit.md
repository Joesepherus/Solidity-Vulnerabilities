<h2>What is Private Variable Exploit?</h2>
<div>
<p>Well simply put, private variables are not really private on the blockchain. Anyone can read them on the blockchain very easily. So if you store some sensitive information passwords, usernames, private keys on the blockchain then everyone can see them.

As the keyword is private, the user is tempted to assume that the variable is not visible outside the contract, but this is not true. If you need to store some sensitive data, never do it on the blockchain. Store them on a privately owned database that only you have access to.
